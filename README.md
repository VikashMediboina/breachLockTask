# breachLockTask
Build a webserver that delivers two pages of application with an authentication: 

An upload page: 

The authentication part should be in NodeJS.
All the pages should be in ReactJS. 
The CSV-file will have to be uploaded; 
The uploaded file will have to be parsed into a MySQL database using NodeJS API.

A display page:

Display all data from the database onto the ReactJS page using async.
This data will have to be updated in (semi-)real-time through the use of a Restful API; 
There are options provided to export the database back to a CSV or XLSX format.
